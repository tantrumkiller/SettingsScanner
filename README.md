### Get the app on [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fourthlap.settingsscanner)

We need some mobile phone settings enabled only for short periods of time. Often we forget to turn them off after use.
Consider an example of your phone's location setting. You don't need it enabled all day. You need it only in certain scenarios, like when you are driving or booking a cab. Such settings if kept enabled creates privacy and security concerns.

SettingsWatcher solves this problem by scanning your phones settings periodically. It reminds you if a setting is enabled. You control what settings are scanned and when you get notified.

## How to use
### 1. Whitelist setting you want scanned

Use simple toggle buttons to enable/disable settings that you want SettingsScanner to scan.

### 2. Configure scan timings

Configure how frequently you want Scanner to run.
Configure your sleep time so that scanner doesn't disturbs your sleep.


### 3. Get reminders

According to configured time, scanner will run and notifies you if any of the whitelisted settings are enabled.
If you donâ€™t want to disable a setting yet, just dismiss the notification. Settings watcher will notify you again during the next scan.
