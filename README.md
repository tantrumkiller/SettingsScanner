# SettingsWatcher
We often need some mobile settings enabled only for short periods of time. But we forget to turn them off after use. Consider an example of your phones location setting. You don't need it enabled all the day. You need it only in certain secarios like when you are driving or booking a cab. This creates privacy and security concerns

SettingsWatcher solves this problem by scanning your mobile's settings periodically and reminding you if a setting is enabled. You control what settings are scanned and when you get notified.

## How to use
### 1. Whitelist setting you want scanned
### 2. Configure scan timings
### 3. Get reminders
### 4. Disable Settings
### 5. Enjoy increased privacy and saftey
